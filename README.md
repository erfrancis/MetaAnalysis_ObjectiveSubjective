# MetaAnalysis_ObjectiveSubjective
This is one of my PhD projects, where I carried out a meta-analysis to determine whether objective and subjective measures of childhood adversity (1) show agreement, and (2) differentially predict psychopathology. 

The "Meta_analysis_objective_subjective_psychopathology_25June22.Rmd" file contains the syntax (R) required to run both the meta-analysis investigating agreement between objective and subjective measures (data file= "Data-extraction_agreement_june2022.xlsx"), as well as the meta-analysis determining whether the measures differentially predict psychopathology (data file= "Data-extraction_june22.xlsx").
